# Battleship

This project is a battleship game that let's you play against a computer.

Instructions: first choose your desired orientation and drag and drop the ships to your desired position, click the start button once all ships have been placed and you can start playing!

The textures are all made by me using [Piskel](https://www.piskelapp.com/) and a [pixelart upscaler](https://www.maxlaumeister.com/pixel-art-upscaler/) to make them look a bit nicer.

The font I used is [Girassol](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Girassol) by Liam Spradlin.

Everything has been coded in vanilla JavaScript!
