## What is it?
This project is a battleship game that let's you play against a computer player. To play you need to choose the desired orientation of your ship and then drag and drop it into the field. Once all ships are in place, click "Start" to start the game. Click on a spot on the Computer's board to attack, if an attack is succesfull, an explosion will show up, otherwise a cross will show up. Once all ships of the opponent sink you win the game, if all your ships sink first, you lose the game. This project is part of The Odin Project's curriculum, the project description can be found [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-battleship).

## What is the purpose?
The main focus of this project was test-driven development and practicing with OOP in JavaScript. At first I wanted to do the project in React, but I found that vanilla JavaScript was easier for me to use in this case.
